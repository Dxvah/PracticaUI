    m_Localized: 'Welcome to The Ashen Knight, where knights and dragons meet! Before
      you venture into our medieval land, here are some rules:



      Kingdom Rules:



      Spend
      your gold wisely, the crown does not cover your debts!



      Modify the
      game however you want, but don''t put on a beginner mage''s robe if you''re
      going to face a Saber Cat with your axe, be smart.



      Communication in
      the Tavern:



      Verbal duels are allowed. The disputes with iron daggers
      forged in the Forge of Heaven, too. If you are a member of The Knights, you
      are strictly prohibited from going out to drink mead late at night, especially
      on full moon days.



      Do not share secrets, unless you wish to receive
      a message from the Dark Brotherhood.



      Weapon Rights and Shields:



      All
      adventurers can carry weapons and shields, as long as they are of legal age
      and have not been wounded in the knee by an arrow.



      Castle Jurisdiction:



      In
      case of disputes, King Ulfric Stormcloak will decide. His word is law and is
      backed by the Divine Seven.





      The Ashen Knight is just a medieval
      game. Don''t take things so seriously, the real battle is out there! Enjoy
      your adventure!



      May your trip be epic!





      (Any resemblance
      to the video game The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is purely coincidental, please
      Bethesda don''t sue me)'
